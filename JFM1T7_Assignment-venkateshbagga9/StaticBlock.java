/* JFM1T7_Assignment5:

   Write a program to create a static method named dispCollegeName to print the value of a static variable  college_name initialized using static block.
   Access this method from another class and display college_name for 3 students who study in same college.
   Prompt the user for the  values to be input from the terminal

   Sample Input:
   Enter the student name: Sri
   Enter the student Roll no: 1
   Enter the student name: Balaji
   Enter the student Roll no: 2
   Enter the student name: Ram
   Enter the student Roll no: 3
   
   Expected Output:
   Student name: Sri
   Student Roll no: 1
   College Name : IIT
   Student name: Balaji
   Student Roll no: 2
   College Name : IIT
   Student name: Ram
   Student Roll no: 3
   College Name : IIT
